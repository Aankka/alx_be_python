# This script performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication)
# on two predefined numbers and prints the results.

# Assign specific values to two variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Perform addition
sum_result = number1 + number2

# Perform subtraction (number2 from number1)
difference_result = number1 - number2

# Perform multiplication
product_result = number1 * number2

# Print the results of each operation in the specified format
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {sum_result}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {difference_result}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {product_result}")
